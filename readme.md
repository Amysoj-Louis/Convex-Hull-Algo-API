# Convex Hull API #

Hi , this is an Flask API to Convert a List of LatLng coordinates to a set of new LatLng coordinates which encloses all the previous selected coordinates. The algo used was coded by [Project Nayuki](https://www.nayuki.io/page/convex-hull-algorithm).

Note: I haven't added the CORS support for websites. If you wish to add CORS refer to this docs of [flask_cors](https://flask-cors.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

Hope you have a good day, Happy Coding :)
